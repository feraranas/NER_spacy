      "Text: The Security Architect leads unique and highly complex projects involving design, development and implementation of secure system architectures. He/She plans and monitors the design of artefacts into enterprise systems that describe security principles and how they relate to the overall enterprise system architecture. He is involved in the development and application of new solutions in infrastructure security. He recommends and leads the adoption of new technological advances and best practices in infrastructure security systems to mitigate security risks. He identifies and resolves unique and complex issues, which may have organisation-wide and long-term impact. He is an expert in cyber security standards, protocols and frameworks, and ensures the organisations compliance to the Cyber Security Act 2018. He is knowledgeable of various application and hardware technologies and services. The Security Architect has a creative and critical mind, and enjoys identifying linkages and interconnections among various parts of a system or architecture. He is a technical expert who should also be people-oriented, consultative, developmental and actively engaging stakeholders to design optimal secure system architectures. He also mentors and provides technical leadership to the junior staff.\n",

He runs experiments to test the performance of deployed models, and identifies and resolves bugs that arise in the process. He works in a team setting and is proficient in statistics, scripting and programming languages required by the organisation. He is also familiar with the relevant software platforms in which the models are deployed. He should be knowledgeable of the requirements under the Model AI Governance Framework and the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in the course of his work on AI/ML models.
