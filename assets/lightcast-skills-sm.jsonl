{"text": "\nDefined by Microsoft for use in recent versions of Windows, an assembly in the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) is a compiled code library used for deployment, versioning, and security. There are two types: process assemblies (EXE) and library assemblies (DLL). A process assembly represents a process that will use classes defined in library assemblies. CLI assemblies contain code in CIL, which is usually generated from a CLI language, and then compiled into machine language at run time by the just-in-time compiler. In the .NET Framework implementation, this compiler is part of the Common Language Runtime (CLR)."}
{"text": "The .NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called \"managed code\". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework."}

These languages require .NET Framework, Mono, or .NET, which provide a basis for software development, platform independence, language interoperability and extensive framework libraries. Standard Libraries are not included in this article."}
{"text": ".NET Reflector is a class browser, decompiler and static analyzer for software created with .NET Framework, originally written by Lutz Roeder. MSDN Magazine named it as one of the Ten Must-Have utilities for developers, and Scott Hanselman listed it as part of his \"Big Ten Life and Work-Changing Utilities\"."}
{"text": ".NET Remoting is a Microsoft application programming interface (API) for interprocess communication released in 2002 with the 1.0 version of .NET Framework. It is one in a series of Microsoft technologies that began in 1990 with the first version of Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for 16-bit Windows. Intermediate steps in the development of these technologies were Component Object Model (COM) released in 1993 and updated in 1995 as COM-95, Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), released in 1997, and COM+ with its Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), released in 2000. It is now superseded by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), which is part of the .NET Framework 3.0."}

{"text": ".nettiers is a code generation tool that helps developers quickly create data access layer code for .NET applications. It generates code based on the database schema, allowing developers to focus on the logic of the application rather than writing tedious data access code."}
{"text": "10 Gigabit Ethernet is a group of computer networking technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of 10 gigabits per second. It was first defined by the IEEE 802.3ae-2002 standard. Unlike previous Ethernet standards, 10 Gigabit Ethernet defines only full-duplex point-to-point links which are generally connected by network switches; shared-medium CSMA/CD operation has not been carried over from the previous generations Ethernet standards so half-duplex operation and repeater hubs do not exist in 10GbE."}
{"text": "1010data is a specialized skill that involves working with a large-scale analytics platform designed to process and analyze massive datasets. It requires expertise in data management, programming, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from complex data sets. 1010data is commonly used in industries such as retail, finance, and healthcare for tasks like market analysis, risk management, and sales forecasting."}
{"text": "Classic Ethernet is a family of 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standards, which is the first generation of Ethernet standards. In 10BASE-X, the 10 represents its maximum throughput of 10 Mbit/s, BASE indicates its use of baseband transmission, and X indicates the type of medium used."}
{"text": "10BASE2 is a variant of Ethernet that uses thin coaxial cable terminated with BNC connectors to build a local area network."}
{"text": "10BASE5 was the first commercially available variant of Ethernet. The technology was standardized in 1982 as IEEE 802.3. 10BASE5 uses a thick and stiff coaxial cable up to 500 meters (1,600 ft) in length. Up to 100 stations can be connected to the cable using vampire taps and share a single collision domain with 10 Mbit/s of bandwidth shared among them. The system is difficult to install and maintain."}
{"text": "12-volt electricity is a specialized skill that requires understanding the rules and regulations of this low voltage power system. It involves working with batteries, switches, and other components that require careful handling to avoid electrocution and other hazards. The skill requires knowledge of wiring, circuits, and proper grounding, along with a deep understanding of electrical principles to ensure safety and reliability. A qualified professional with experience in 12-volt electricity can help design and install systems for RVs, boats, and other specialized applications."}
{"text": "In computer architecture, 128-bit integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are 128 bits wide. Also, 128-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size."}
{"text": "12factor is a methodology for building modern, cloud-native applications that are scalable, portable, and maintainable. It provides guidelines for things like configuration, dependencies, scaling, and monitoring, and emphasizes the use of stateless processes, dev/prod parity, and automated build, release, and deployment processes. The 12factor approach aims to make it easier to manage and update complex applications, reduce downtime and errors, and enable faster iteration and deployment."}
